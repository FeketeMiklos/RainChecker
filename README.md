# RainChecker
A weather app that gives you a forecast for the day, it also tells you to bring an umbrella with you if you go out if it will rain.
For now I only added Győr and Veszprém as cities (as I mostly stay there) but it can be modified to include more cities.

Made specifically for a Samsung Galaxy A22 so it may look off if you have a different phone. Android only.
